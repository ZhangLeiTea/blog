### attribute vs property
In python, everything is an object. And every object has attributes and methods or functions. 
  Attributes are described by data variables for example like name, age, height etc.
  Properties are special kind of attributes which have getter, setter and delete methods like __get__, __set__ and __delete__ methods.
